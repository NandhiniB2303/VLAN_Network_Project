# VLAN_Network_Project
This project demonstrates the implementation of VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) and Inter-VLAN Routing using a router and a switch in Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is segmented into three VLANs, each with its own PC, printer, and access point. Inter-VLAN communication is enabled using the Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS) method.
